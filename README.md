# RecipeRandomizer
A Recipe Randomizer Side Project

A side project built with a sql database (using pgAdmin and PostgresSQL) and Java (using Intellij). 

Has the ability to call recipes and food categories (via Postman) as well as the ability to pull a random recipe from the database, in case you do not know what you are in the mood for.
